   *   Connected the app to a MongoDB database to store scraped product information.
   *   Implemented database insertion and retrieval for search queries.

*  **Flask Backend**:
   *  Created Flask routes to handle user search requests and display results.
   *  Managed backend flow to ensure smooth data retrieval and display.
